# Udagram Fullstack Project

## Project Overview

The Udagram Fullstack Project is a comprehensive web application developed as part of the FWD-Udacity scholarship program. The project leverages a PostgreSQL database hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Relational Database Service (RDS), a Node.js server hosted and served on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, and an Angular front-end project statically hosted on AWS Simple Storage Service (S3).

This project is designed to provide users with a seamless experience as they navigate between the front-end and back-end components of the application. The app also provides a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline that leverages CircleCI to automate the deployment process, thereby ensuring that the application is always up-to-date and functioning optimally.

In this document, we provide a comprehensive guide to the Udagram Fullstack Project, including an overview of the project, an outline of the documentation and files included, and instructions on how to deploy the application.
