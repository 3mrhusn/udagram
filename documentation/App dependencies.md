## Front-End Dependencies

The front-end of the application was built using the following dependencies:

- @angular/common
- @angular/core
- @angular/forms
- @angular/http
- @angular/platform-browser
- @angular/platform-browser-dynamic
- @angular/router

Angular is a popular framework for building dynamic web applications. These packages provide essential functionality for creating and manipulating web pages, forms, and routing.

- @ionic-native/core
- @ionic-native/splash-screen
- @ionic-native/status-bar

Ionic Native provides a set of Angular directives for integrating native device features into hybrid applications. These packages provide access to the core features of a mobile device, such as the status bar and splash screen.

- @ionic/angular

Ionic is a popular framework for building hybrid mobile applications. The @ionic/angular package provides a set of Angular directives for building hybrid applications with Ionic.

- core-js

Core-js is a collection of polyfills for the latest JavaScript features. It allows you to use the latest JavaScript syntax and features, while maintaining compatibility with older browsers.

- rxjs

RxJS is a library for reactive programming using Observables. It allows you to work with asynchronous data streams and handle events and data changes in a reactive and efficient way.

- zone.js

Zone.js is a library for managing asynchronous operations in Angular applications. It provides a way to track the lifecycle of asynchronous operations and handle errors and other events.

## Back-End Dependencies

The back-end of the application was built using the following dependencies:

- body-parser

Body-parser is a middleware for handling JSON, URL-encoded, and multipart form data. It allows you to parse incoming request bodies in a convenient way.

- cors

Cors is a middleware for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Node.js. It allows you to configure the server to accept requests from other domains or subdomains.

- express

Express is a popular web framework for Node.js. It provides a set of tools and utilities for building web applications, including routing, middleware, and templating.

- jsonwebtoken

Jsonwebtoken is a library for working with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). It allows you to generate, sign, and verify JWTs, which can be used for authentication and authorization in web applications.

- mongoose

Mongoose is an Object-Document Mapper (ODM) for MongoDB. It provides a way to define data models and interact with MongoDB databases using JavaScript objects.

- nodemon

Nodemon is a tool for automatically restarting Node.js applications when changes are detected. It allows you to develop and debug Node.js applications more efficiently.

- passport
- passport-jwt
- passport-local

Passport is a popular authentication middleware for Node.js. It provides a way to authenticate users using different strategies, such as local authentication or JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). The passport-jwt and passport-local packages provide additional strategies for JWT-based and username/password authentication, respectively.

- typescript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to the language. It allows you to write more robust and maintainable code, and provides better tooling and error checking than JavaScript alone.

## Conclusion

This project uses a variety of front-end and back-end dependencies to build a web application with dynamic functionality and mobile device integration. By leveraging these packages, developers can build web applications quickly and efficiently, while maintaining compatibility with a wide range of platforms and devices.
